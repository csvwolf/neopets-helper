# Neopets Helper

The tool aims to better and more comfortable playing experience.

To Run it, you need:

- Golang 1.15
- Redis (If you want to use shop wizard to getting advised price)

It's not a good idea to traverse items in neopets item DB. Only use the API when you want to check some price.

It's best usage is install with [neopets wizard](https://github.com/csvwolf/neopets-wizard).

More and more services will be added.
